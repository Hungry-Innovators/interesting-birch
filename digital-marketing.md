          Search engine optimisation is a vital part of digital marketing and
          without ongoing SEO, businesses soon find that their ranking drops
          back. Local search optimisation is also important for your small
          business, with a large percentage of customers checking online reviews
          prior to making a purchase or visiting your website.
